## Introduction
A simple implementation of a color base tracker.
## IMPLEMENTATION
### States
- **Intro.** The base state of the program, controls are explained there.
- **Tracker.** The camera will move around the screen depending on where the tacked color is, speed varies based in the distance of the dot from the center of the camera.
- **Stabilizer.** In this case the program will try to keep the tracked color in the middle of the screen by moving the camera around.
### Controls
- PRESS ENTER to turn START/STOP.
- PRESS TAB to swap between tracker and stabilizer.
- LEFT-CLICK to choose the color to track.

## RESULT
![visualisation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72495040/159350207-f9012252-149b-46f0-810e-e6d5bbbc1dbb.gif)

## Notes
I strongly recommed trying this program whitn a solid color background and a good contrast between the colors.
The camera may fail, I don't know the reason, processing seems to not be able to recognize it from time to time.
